            <p>THE LITTLE MONK: But I would mention other reasons. Let me speak for a moment of myself. I grew up as a
                son of peasants in the Campagna. They were simple people. They knew all about olive-trees, but very
                little else. </p>
            <p>While observing the phases of Venus, I can see my parents, sitting by the hearth with my sister, eating
                their cheese. I see above them the beams blackened by centuries of smoke, and I see clearly their old,
                work-worn hands and the little spoons they hold. They are not rich, but even in their misfortune there
                lies concealed a certain invisible order of things. There are those various rounds of duties, from
                scrubbing the floor, through the seasons in the olive grove, to the payment of taxes. There is even
                regularity in the disasters that befall them. My father’s back becomes bent, not suddenly, but more and
                more each spring among the olive-trees, just as the child-bearings which have made my mother less and
                less a woman have followed one another at regular intervals. But they call up the strength to sweat up
                the stony paths with their baskets, to bear children, yes, even to eat, from the feeling of continuity
                and necessity which is given them by the sight of die soil, of the trees springing with new green
                foliage every year, of the little church, and by listening every Sunday to the Bible texts. They have
                been assured that the eye of God rests upon them; searchingly, yes, almost anxi-ously - that the whole
                universe has been built up round them in order that they, the actors, can play their greater or lesser
                parts. What would my people say if they learned from me that they were really on a little bit of rock
                that ceaselessly revolves in empty space round another star, one among very many, a comparatively
                unimportant one? Why is such patience, such acceptance of their misery, either necessary or good today?
                Why is there still virtue in Holy Writ, which explains everything and has established the necessity of
                toil, endurance, hunger, resignation, and which now is found to be full of errors? No, I see their eyes
                grow frightened! I see them dropping their spoons on the hearth stone. I see how they feel cheated and
                betrayed. </p>
            <p>So there is no eye resting upon us, they say. We must look after our selves, untaught, old and worn out
                as we are? No one has provided a part for us on this earthly, miserable, tiny star which is not
                independent and round which nothing revolves? There is no meaning in our misery, hunger is simply
                not-having-eaten, and not a test of strength; exertion is just stooping and tugging - with nothing to
                show. So do you understand that in that decree of the Holy Congregation I perceive true maternal
                compassion, great goodness of soul?
